# Word_Guess_Game aka Hip Hop Hangman

This This is Hip Hop Hangman. 
Words are selected at random from the full titles of my favorite songs. 
Guess a letter to begin but be mindful of how many guess attempts you have remaining!

Future development plans include the following mods:

(1) greater mobile responsiveness
(2) a second part of the game whereas the first part is guessing a word from the full title of the song, the second part--to be developed, tested, and deployed--would then prompt the user to guess the title in full and;
(3) The third part: guessing the year of its release. 
(4) Upon all three parts being correctly guessed, the game would open a YouTube iFrame with a video of the song that would play as the next game begins

Here is the deployed link:
